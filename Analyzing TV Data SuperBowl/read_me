  I found this project in the DataCamp's course. Before everything, despite having written most of the codes, the html parts were ready
  when I started. It's very simple project that helped me alot in my beginning data science studies. Have fun.

  About the project:
  
  Whether or not you like football, the Super Bowl is a spectacle. There's a little something for everyone at your Super Bowl party. Drama
in the form of blowouts, comebacks, and controversy for the sports fan. There are the ridiculously expensive ads, some hilarious, others
gut-wrenching, thought-provoking, and weird. The half-time shows with the biggest musicians in the world, sometimes riding giant mechanical
tigers or leaping from the roof of the stadium. And in this notebook, we're going to find out how some of the elements of this show interact
with each other. After exploring and cleaning our data a little, we're going to answer questions like:


   * What are the most extreme game outcomes?
   * How does the game affect television viewership?
   * How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time?
   * Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?
